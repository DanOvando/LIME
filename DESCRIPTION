Version: 2.0.4
Authors@R: person("Merrill", "Rudd", email="merrillrudd@gmail.com", role=c("aut","cre"))
Description: A flexible stock assessment method for fisheries with developing
    data collection programs. Requires at least one year of length composition
    data and assumptions about biological parameters. Can integrate more years of
    length composition data, a time series of catch, and/or an abundance index.
    Mixed effects structure accounts for time-variation in fishing mortality and
    recruitment.
