Length-based Integrated Mixed Effects stock assessment method for data-limited fisheries.
- Accounts for time-varying fishing mortality and recruitment
- Requires at least 1 year of length composition data of the catch, and assumptions about growth, natural mortality, and maturity
- Estimates annual fishing mortality, age at 50% selectivity, and recruitment variation
- Derives random effects for time-varying recruitment
- Can fit to more years of length composition data and/or catch and/or an abundance index time series, if available.
- Estimates spawning potential ratio reference points (and MSY-based reference points if there is information on scale, e.g. catch data)
